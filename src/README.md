## What I Leaned
- I learned about basic file input/output operations using Java IO.
- I executed tests using JUnit5.
- I set up CI with GitHub Actions.

Although each task was simple, they are fundamental skills that I want to master and use as my strengths.

## References
For CI, I referred to the following:
